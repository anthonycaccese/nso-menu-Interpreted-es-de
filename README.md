# NSO Menu Interpreted (ES-DE Version)
A simple theme for the version of EmulationStation used in [ES-DE](https://es-de.org/) v2.x.  The design is inspired by the Menu UI from [Nintendo Switch Online](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Switch_Online).  It includes a custom grid view built to match the cover artwork for each supported system.

This theme was created in collaboration with [@rogs123](https://github.com/rogs123)

## **Configuration Options**
- The theme has a simple set of options that can be changed directly from the UI Settings menu of ES-DE 
- `Theme Aspect Ratio` - sets the aspect ratio the theme will render at. If needed, this should be changed to match the aspect ratio of your screen.
   - 16:9 and 16:10 aspect ratios are supported
- `Theme Variant` - sets the layout used for the system view.  There are 4 system view variants to choose from:
   - Controllers
   - Controllers (Flat Color)
   - Logos (B/W)
   - Logos (Color)
   - Colorful (*note: depending on the amount of systems you display you may need to increase your VRAM in ES-DE to use this variant*)
   - Colorful (Flat Color)
